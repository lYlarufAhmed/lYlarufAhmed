### 🧠 About Me

I'm a mid-level **Full Stack Developer** with a *mobile-first mindset* — I build cross-platform apps that run smoothly, scale easily, and look good while doing it. My work blends front-end precision with back-end reliability, often pushing performance up by optimization and smart architecture decisions.  

I’ve led and mentored engineering teams, built secure authentication flows, and implemented complex API integrations that actually *work*. My sweet spot is where **React, React Native, and Python** meet to create user-focused digital products.

Currently, I’m the **Co-founder & CTO at [OmniVeo](https://omniveo.io)**, where I’m leading the architecture and AI layer of an assistant that can literally *see your screen and hear you*.

### 📈 What Drives Me

Startups, scalability, and solving the kind of bugs that keep you up at 2 a.m. (in a good way). I love the tension between *perfect code* and *real-world delivery*, and I’m drawn to teams that value learning as much as building.
